# Referrer Compliance Tool

## Description
- This tool is used to help adjust script retargeting tags to pass back the correct referrer information. 
- With most browsers moving to strict-origin-when-cross-origin for their referrer policy, it's becoming hard to get the right information passed back to retarget users on. 
- This tool helps fix that issue both when placed in the HTML and placed in a container tag like GTM. 

## How To Use
- Determine if you are placing the tag within HTML or a container. 
- Input the website you are placing the tag on and the parameters to encode (if necessary).
- Copy exported script tag.
